# BCMS

BCMS is a CMS (Content Management System) created and developed by a company [Becomes](https://becomes.co). BCMS is a headless CMS and provides a grate API, best in class model builder and intuitive content editor. It was created because of project needs in our company and we decided to make it Open-Source since it solved a lot of problems that we had with other CMS solutions. We hope that you will find it useful in your next project.

## Getting started

BCMS can be as complex or as simple as required. This repository is the BCMS Core which is composed of 3 core packages: [backend](https://github.com/becomesco/cms-backend/), [UI](https://github.com/becomesco/cms-ui/) and [bundler](https://github.com/becomesco/cms-bundler/). Running BCMS locally is as simple as running few command in the terminal.

- Clone the repository by running `git clone git@github.com:becomesco/cms bcms`,
- Enter the directory by running `cd bcms` and install dependencies by running `npm i`,
- And finally start the BCMS in development node by running `npm run dev`. First, backend will be started and few seconds later UI will be started.
- Open the browser and navigate to `http://localhost:1280`
