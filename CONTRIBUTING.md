## Opening issues
Before submitting an issue, please check all existing open and closed issues to see if your issue has been resolved or is already known. If an issue is already logged, feel free to upvote it by adding a üëç [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). 
If you would like to submit a new issue, please fill out our [Issue Template](https://github.com/bcms/cms/issues/new/choose) to the best of your ability so we can accurately understand your report.

## Security issues and vulnerabilities
If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email security@thebcms.com instead.
Any security issues should be submitted directly to security@thebcms.com. 
To determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
Can I access something that's not mine or something I shouldn't have access to?
Can I disable something for other people?
If the answer to either of those two questions is "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at security@thebcms.com.
